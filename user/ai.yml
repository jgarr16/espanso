      Have you checked out ChatGSFC yet? This is a technology demonstration that serves as a great example of the kind of GenAI tools that NASA is developing. Check out the 4-minute video on their SharePoint site at https://nasa.sharepoint.com/sites/AIML/SitePages/new.aspx. 
      
      High-level - it's a mult-model tool (e.g., Anthropic Claude, and OpenAI ChatGPT) that uses a really nice web interface. It's more like what you might be used to with proprietary products like ChatGPT, but it works with internal, non-ITAR/EAR/PII data. 
      
      ChatGSFC is available on a time-limited trial. If you are interested, you can submit a NAMS request: https://idmax.nasa.gov/nams/asset/270307 (they normally provision access very quickly). 
      
      Check it out and let me know what you think.
